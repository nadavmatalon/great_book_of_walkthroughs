book are loaded properly)

## General Notes

* Text in square brackets must be removed completely (including the brackets) and 
replaced with the user's choice as appropriate (see example in step 1).

* If a file's location isn't specified explicitly, that file is in the root director 
of the project.

* __You are strongly advised not push to the remote github repo before adding the 
"secrets.yml" to the .gitignore list__ (See: step 10)


## Setting up a new Ruby on Rails project with PostgreSQL databases:

	(*)	Check currently installed versions of Ruby and Rails:

		Terminal>	ruby -v

		Terminal>	rails -v

		To update installation of Rails:

		Terminal>	gem update rails


	(1)	Terminal>	rails new [name_of_project_lower_case] -T -B -d postgresql

		Alternatively, it is possible to create defualt settings for all new rails
		projects as follows:

		Terminal> cd ~

		Terminal> ls -a 	

		Check if there's a file called: ".railsrc", and if not:

			create it with: 	Terminal> 	touch .railsrc

			and open it with: 	Terminal> 	subl .railsrc	

		Put the following content into the ".railsrc" file:

			-d postgresql		// sets the project's database to postresql

			-T  				// doesn't include default testing units (to enable using Rspec)

			-B  				// skips immidiate bundle install right after project creation


		Save the ".railsrc" file and close it.

		From now on it's possible to simply use: 	

		Terminal> 	rails new [name_of_project_lower_case]


	(2)	Terminal>	cd [name_of_project_lower_case]


	(3)	Terminal> 	subl .


	(4)	Update the "Gemfile" file to include:

		(in tandem, go over the README of each Gem in the documentation - links above each 
		 gem below - and verify current versions and updated installation instructions)

			ruby '2.1.1'   	# update this according to currently used Ruby version

			group :doc do
				# https://github.com/voloko/sdoc
				gem 'sdoc', '~> 0.4.0'
			end

			group :test do
				# https://github.com/vertis/selenium-webdriver
				# gem 'selenium-webdriver'  # not installed for now
			end

			group :test, :development do
				# https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails
				gem 'rspec-rails'
				# https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara
				gem 'capybara'
				# https://github.com/cldwalker/debugger
				gem 'debugger'
				# https://github.com/copiousfreetime/launchy
				gem 'launchy'
				# https://github.com/rweng/pry-rails
				gem 'pry-rails'
			    # https://github.com/rspec/rspec-collection_matchers
			    # gem 'rspec-collection_matchers'
			end

			group :development do
				#  https://github.com/rails/spring
				gem 'spring'
			end

			group :production do
				# https://github.com/heroku/rails_12factor	
			 	# gem 'rails_12factor'	 #	not necessary for now (will only be needed for deployment)
			end

		(Important: Make sure to remove Duplications, e.g. 'sdocs', 'spring')


	(5)	Terminal> 	bundle install

		(If the Bundler complains about a 'readline' error, try adding the gem 'rb-readline'
		 to the Gemfile and do a bundle install)	

		(optional) bundle install commands:

		Terminal>	bundle install --without production

		Terminal>	bundle update

		Terminal>	bundle install

		If using this alternative set of commands, the gems under the'production' group in the Gemfile will be 
		installed only by Heroku during deployment (in other words, gems in this group will not be installed locally - 
		note that this kind of install must be done on the FIRST bundle install command otherwise won't limit 
		the 'production' gem installation. Also, note that after the first time, you can use just 'buntle install' 
		as usual and 'production' gems will not be installed).


	(6)	Terminal> 	bin/rails generate rspec:install

		Alternative shorthand:

		Terminal>	bin/rails g rspec:install

		Also, check if the "spec/features" folder exists and if not - create it manually.	


	(7)	(optional) Update the “.rspec” file to have the following content:

			--color
			--format documentation
			--require spec_helper


	(8)	(optional) To install “rspec-collection_matchers” gem (extends syntax for rspec testing):

		Uncomment this line in the "Gemfile":

			gem 'rspec-collection_matchers'


		Add the following line at the top of “spec/helpers/rspec_helper.rb”:

			require 'rspec/collection_matchers'

		And then:

			Terminal> 	bundle install


	(9)	(optional) Rename the “README.rdoc” file to “README.md”


	(10)	In “/app/assets/javascripts/application.js”, remove the third element from the top ("turbo-links") 
			and leave only the following three:

			//= require jquery
			//= require jquery_ujs
			//= require_tree .


			And in "app/views/layouts/application.html.erb":

			remove the references to ‘turbo links’ from the <head> section


	(11)	Update the “.gitignore” file to include:

				# Ignore the secrets files.
 					/config/secrets.yml

				# Ignore other unneeded files.
					doc/
					*.swp
					*~
					.project
					.DS_Store
					.idea
					.secret


	(12)	(optional) Add “.scss” to the following file: "app/assets/stylesheets/application.css”

			(end-result: "application.css.scss")


	(13)	Terminal> 	rspec  			// this is just to make sure rspec is running correctly


	(14)	In "config/database.yml", add the following line immidiately after the "pool: 5" line:

				host: localhost


	(15)	Terminal> 	bin/rake db:create


	(16)	(optional - but important!) 	

			Sometimes the previous command (bin/rake db:create) will only create a 'development' database.

			To check if the 'test' database already exists:

				Terminal>		psql

				Terminal # >	\list

			check if '[project_name_lower_case]_test' is already on the list and exit psql mode:

				Terminal # >	\q

			If not, to create the 'test' database (needed for Rspec testing and possibly other things):

				Terminal> 	bin/rake db:create RAILS_ENV=test


	(17)	Set up a local Github repo:

 			Terminal>	git init

			Terminal> 	git add .

			Terminal>	git status

			go over the list and make sure "config/secrets.yml" is NOT on it
			
			Terminal>	git commit -m "initial commit"


	(18)	Create a Github remote repo and then link them together:

			Terminal>	git remote add origin [Github_ssh_address_of_repo]

			Terminal>	git push -u origin master	


	(19)	(optional) Update the “.gitignore” file to include:
			(the idea is to have this file in the remote Github repo for other developers to use,
			but to keep all the changes you might make locally)

			# Ignore the secrets files.
				/config/database.yml


	(20)	(optional) To test code and check the content of the development database:

				Terminal>	bin/rails console

			To test code and work with 'development' database without affecting its contents:

				Terminal>	bin/rails console --sandbox

			To test code and see content of 'test' database:

				Terminal>	bin/rails console test


	(21)	(optional) To add a "reset.css" file so as to reset the default css styling of browsers:

			Create a new file: “app/vendor/assets/stylesheets/reset.css”
			(note that the new file should be located in the 'vendors' folder)

			Copy the content for this file from: http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/  (or any other provider you prefer)

			(updated content for the file: http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2011/01/03/reset-revisited/)

			In "app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss", add the following line ABOVE the other two existing lines as follows:
		
				*= require reset
				*= require_tree .
				*= require_self

			(if the '*=require reset' line is not located above all the other 'require' lines, it WILL mess up your css styling and browser rendering)


	(22)	(optional) To make sure webpages load fully before functionality becomes available, in “app/assets/javascripts” files, use:

			$(document).ready(function() {

				[js code]

			});


	(23)	(optional) HTML5 Shim

			To help tackle problems in redering older browser than IE9:

			Create a new file: “app/views/layouts/_shim.html.erb” 

			Add the following content (known as: “HTML5 shim”):

			<!--[if lt IE 9]>
			<script src="http://html5shim.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>
			<![endif]-->

			(content taken from: https://code.google.com/p/html5shim/)

			Add the following line in “app/views/layouts/application.html.erb” at the end of the <head> section:

			(note that this is the <head> section and not the <header> section)

			<%= render 'layouts/shim' %>

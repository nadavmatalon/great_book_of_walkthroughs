###General Notes

* For a basic Ruby on Rails project setup please refer to the 
  [New Project Setup](./ror_new_project_setup.md) in this folder.
* The following instructions have been written for projects using 
  [Rails 4.0](http://rubyonrails.org/) or later &amp; 
  [Devise 3.2.4](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) or later. 
* Text in ALL_CAPITALS_AND_UNDERSCORES indicated a __placeholder__ for your own text

the steps presented in this walkthrough.


###Adding 'Devise to the Gemfile

Add the following gem to the `Gemfile`:

```ruby
# https://github.com/plataformatec/devise
gem 'devise', '~> 3.2.4'
```

__Note:__ you can change the version of `Devise` from `3.2.4` to the 
version you have installed if you prefer.

Save the file and in terminal run:

```bash
$> bundle install
```

And then:

```bash
$> bin/rails generate devise:install

```

###Configuring Devise

In accordance with the on-screen instructions that will appear after the previous 
command:

In `config/environments/development.rb`, add this line:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost:3000' }
```

In `config/environments/test.rb`, add this line:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost:3000' }
```

In `config/routes.rb`, make sure that the `root_url` is defined, for example:

```ruby
root to: "home#index"
```

In `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` add the following lines in 
the `<body>` section:

```
<p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
<p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>
```

To have access to the various `devise` views, in terminal run:

```bash	
$> bin/rails generate devise:views
```


###Generating a Devise 'User' Model

To generate the basic devise `User` model (just `email` and `password`), 
in terminal run:	

```bash	
$> bin/rails generate devise user
$> bin/rake db:migrate
$> bin/rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
```

Open a new tab of terminal and run (or re-start) the Rails server:

```bash	
$> bin/rails server
```

Then open the browser of your choice and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000/users/sign_up
	
http://localhost:3000/users/sign_in
```

### Adding a 'username' to the 'User' Model

To add a "username" attribute to users, in terminal run:

```bash
$> bin/rails generate migration add_name_to_users username:string
$> bin/rake db:migrate
$> bin/rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
```

### Updating Premitted Parameters

In `app/controllers/application_controller.rb`, update the content to the following:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  # Prevent CSRF attacks by raising an exception.
  # For APIs, you may want to use :null_session instead.
  protect_from_forgery with: :null_session

  before_filter :configure_permitted_parameters, if: :devise_controller?

  protected

  def configure_permitted_parameters
    devise_parameter_sanitizer.for(:sign_in) { |u| u.permit(:username, :email, :password, :remember_me) }
    devise_parameter_sanitizer.for(:sign_up) { |u| u.permit(:username, :email, :password, :password_confirmation) }
    devise_parameter_sanitizer.for(:account_update) { |u| u.permit(:username, :email, :password, :password_confirmation, :current_password) }
  end

end
```

### Changing Authentication from 'Email' to 'Username'

If you want to change the way `devise` authenticates users from being based on 
__email__to being based on __username__:

In `app/models/user.rb`, change the content to the following:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  # Include default devise modules. Others available are:
  # :lockable, :timeoutable and :omniauthable
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable, :confirmable, 
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable, :validatable
         authentication_keys: [ :username ]
end
```


### Setting the Devise Secret

In `config/initializers/devise.rb`, uncomment the following line:

```ruby
config.secret_key = â€¦
```

To this:

```ruby
config.secret_key = Rails.application.secrets.devise_secret_key
```

Next, generate a new secret key in terminal:

```bash
$> bin/rake secret
```

Copy the new secret key and in `config/secrets.yml`, change the secret key 
for the 'test' environment to this new key:

```yml
test:
devise_secret_key: NEW_SECRET_KEY
```

Repeat this process twice more for the `development` and `production` environments.


When done, push to Github.

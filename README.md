## The Great Book of Walkthroughs 
###(in the making...)

### Brief Intro

Taking the first steps in any new development domain - be it Ruby, Javascript or Ruby on Rails - is often the hardest part. 

Walkthroughs are a great way to facilitate the transition from this initial (clueless) phase to a more productive & efficient level of competance. 

So, here's the big idea in a nutshell: rather than having each of us spending hours poring over every available the screen-casts, skimming through countless websites, while making our own private notes, we can combine forces and create an extensive repository of walkthroughs.

Each of these walkthroughs is meant to ofer a succict, step-by-step guidance on a specific topics, coupled with useful tips, pitfall warnings and perhaps a few selected resources. 

Beyond its substantial time-saving potential and capacity to serve as an effective learning-tool for those who take part in writing it, the Great Book of Walkthroughs could also be our gift to the next generations of cohorts at Makers Academy.


### (Provisional) Guidlines

(to be imporved, revised, updated, and changed in any odd way according to everyone's suggestions)

(1) The walkthough topic can be anything you like, from generic ones like "Setting Up a New Project in Ruby on Rails" or "Setting Up a Ruby Project with Sinatra", to example-specific ones like "Using the Github API".

The "Division of Labor" section below lists all the topics which have currently been chosen as well as a few open suggestions (but, once again, you can choose to write about anything you like regardless of these suggestions).

(2) To get started simply pick a topic, preferably one that hasn't been covered yet and let me know so I'll update the list.

It's probably also a good idea to take a look at the various pills & walkthroughs available on the Maker's website. If there's an excellent walkthough there already, there may not be a need to write a new one (but do send me a link and we'll possibly make a list of those for reference). 

On the other hand, it's possible that an the exiting materials could serve as a useful source for a walkthrough in the format promoted here. 

(3) All walkthroughs will be available on Github. 

To share your walkthrough, simply fork this repository, add your file to the walkthroughs folder, push to your remote repo, send me a pull request and I'll merge it into the general repo.

(4) The walkthroughs themselves need not be long or extensive (though they could be if you prefer to write them that way), nor should they take long to write. The idea is to provide just the basic squence of little steps to guide someone who knows little to nothing about a particular subject. Alternatively, they could serve as a 'ckecklist' to make sure all the necessary steps have been taken.

For general referece, I attached a partial example under "ror_new_project_setup_Nadav" in the walkthroughs folder (though please bear in mind that it is still in very much in raw form and will require more editing, tweaking & formatting before it's complete).

(5) For now, please use the .md ('markdown') file formats for the walkthroughs.

(6) In terms of content the most important thing is to keep to the "step-by-step" paradigm.

(7) Try to provide succinct yet specific information about where each step is taken (terminal, browser, etc - in projects with a large number of files this will be particularly helpful). Another example is adding a link-pointer to the Github repository of a Gem when the latter is to be included in the Gemfile.

(8) Try to offer a clear distinction between essential steps & optional ones.

(9) A possilble way to write a walkthrough is simply to follow one of the many available screen-casts and iterate each of the steps as they come. In this context, some subsequent editing might be needed in order to make the content generic so that it'll be useful for other project as well.

(10) Another possiblity is to pair up for a few hours and write a walkthrough on a chosen subject together.

(11) The question of how to incorporate testing in these basic walkthroughs is a tricky subject. One approach could be to initially leave testing aside and later create a complementary doc to accompany the main walkthrough in which a list possible tests is given. Another approach may be to combine the testing with the walkthrough itself (the difficulty here is that it may requires constant switching and changing between sublime, terminal and the browser and therefore become very hard to write up succinctly). Hopefully we'll come up with good ways of do this as we go along.

(12) There isn't a specific timeline for all this, but given that it should only take a few hours to write a walkthrough, plus the fact that they'll be very useful to all of us in the next few weeks, it'd be great if we could create as many of them as we can in the comming days.

(13) Please let me know about any suggestions, improvements, corrections etc. that you may have :-)
